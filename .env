# This file is a template. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE UNLESS IT IS RENAMED TO .env.local
# HOW TO USE THIS
# 1. Copy this file and paste it in the same location with the new name ".env.local"
# 2. Edit .env.local and replace ABCD1234 with your Neocities API Key. (See installation guide for more info).
# 3. You should now be able to run npm run upload.

# DO NOT place your API key in this file - only in .env.local.
# DO NOT share your API key with anybody.

# Your API Key goes here.
NEOCITIES_API="ABCD1234"

# Push to a subdirectory (optional)
# If this is set, your blog will be uploaded to a folder instead of the main site.
# e.g. if NEOCITIES_SUBDIRECTORY="blog", your site will upload to example.neocities.org/blog/ instead of example.neocities.org
# IF YOUR SITE ALREADY HAS CONTENT IN IT (LIKE A HOMEPAGE), be sure to set this, because uploading will OVERWRITE that content!
