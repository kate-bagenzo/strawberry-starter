Strawberry Starter is a quick blog template that came about after thinking about the recent drive towards personal sites, and the push away from large social media. While there's been a lot of sentiment that someone should ditch big socials in favor of a personal site or blog... there's actually very little around in terms of good options for beginners to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had been editing my own site as well as making some sites for family and friends and clients, and decided that maybe I can help add to the pool of options.

My hope for Strawberry Starter is that someone with very little webdev experience can download it and enjoy it without having to do anything complicated, and that maybe, after a bit of reading and experimentation, they'll feel confident enough to start playing around with HTML and CSS!

Strawberry Starter doesn't use JavaScript, and every file outside of the layouts are markdown, meaning that anyone can get started with writing posts.

    Zonelets led to the initial spark that created this project. I liked the idea, but I wanted something that didn't require writing in HTML.
