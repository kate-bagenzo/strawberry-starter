This post is a showcase of how to write Markdown, featuring various examples of the elements you can create. Open this post in a text editor so you can see exactly how they've been added.

Additionally, I also recommend reading [a Markdown guide like this one](https://www.markdownguide.org/), or at least having it handy, so you can consult it when necessary.

Fruitcake dessert marshmallow cake oat cake caramels jelly. Cake marshmallow carrot cake fruitcake muffin gingerbread tootsie roll sugar plum. Bonbon pudding wafer powder halvah lollipop dessert. Jelly-o chocolate bar cake topping cotton candy cotton candy halvah powder.

If you want line breaks  
Just add two spaces  
At the end of your sentence  

## Strong Text and Emphasis
You can use **double asterisks** for strong text, and *single asterisks* for emphasis.  
Those will usually show up as bold and italics, but themes/custom styling can override that!
***You can also use triple asterisks for both of them***.

## Blockquotes
> This is a blockquote!

> ### Blockquotes are quite neat
>
> You can do many things with them.
> - As you can see, you can put other elements inside them.
>
>> They ***sure*** are a lot of **fun**.

## Lists
Names for "Strawberry" in a few languages:  
1. "morango"
2. "fresa"
3. "fraise"
4. "jagoda"

- This is also a list
- However
    - It's unordered
    - I think it's still cool
- Don't you agree?

* You can also use an asterisk.
    * If you prefer.
    - You can even mix the two!

## Code Blocks
If you need to `code`, you can use `backticks`.
```
# you can also create fenced code blocks
# for multiline stuff
if (strawberry) {
    console.log('yum!');
};
```

## Links
To create a link, like, for example, [one to my site](https://bagenzos.house), just use square brackets for the text, and round brackets for the URL.

## Images
Images are fundamental to any blog, right?  
It's similar to the link syntax, except the square brackets are for alt text, and the round brackets are for the file path. Also, don't forget the exclamation mark!

## HTML
<p>Finally, when Markdown just doesn't cut it, you CAN write HTML, if you really want to. <em>Any valid HTML is also valid Markdown.</em></p>
<p>You probably don't <em>want</em> to write HTML! But it does mean you can paste things in your posts like, for example, Youtube embeds!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WEv5ZqkaS54?si=mcG95jGYfg2U0tdW&amp;controls=0&amp;start=12" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

That's it for this post! There's more you can do, but I think this covers most use cases. Be sure to read a full Markdown guide!
