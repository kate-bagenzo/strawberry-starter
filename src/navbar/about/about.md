Strawberry Starter is an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) blog template that came about as I thought about the recent push towards personal websites. There's been growing sentiment that social media is bad that that we should ditch it in favor of blogs and personal homepages, but... there's not many great options out there if you're a beginner to HTML/CSS/JS.  
Lately I've been doing so much webdev my brain feels like it's on fire, and in my fury I decided that maybe I could help add to the pool of tools.  
My hope for this template is that someone with little dev experience can download and use it, and that it'll spur them towards a path of learning about HTML and CSS!

    - Zonelets is a huge inspiration to me! Part of my design goal for Strawberry Starter was basically "Zonelets but without needing to write HTML".

    - Finally, static site generation that's good! This is the most intuitive SSG I've used and it has totally rekindled my love for webdev.
